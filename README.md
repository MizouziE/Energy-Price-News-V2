# Energy-Price-News-V2
Taking all the good from the old project and rewriting with improvements in Go

Please see [the original project](https://github.com/Energy-Price-News-API/energy-prices-api) that this will be base on. I'm very grateful to all those that contributed and am still very proud of how it turned out.

## New Direction
Now that I have a little more experience in some other languages and ways of doing things, I would like to recreate the project from the ground up. Ultimately the desired result will be the same and aesthetically (at least from my contributions) this will end up looking almost exactly the same.

There will be a few changes, mainly:
- Back end and API to be written in Go
- Use of a MySQL/MariaDB database to store the data that is ultimately served
- Introduce a `Users` element to allow those with credentials to manage the data
    - This will lead to a side project for the data management UI

There will be other differnces, but as the project is in it's first hour I will hold my horses and get the important stuff done first.

### What I look forward to
- The chance to collaborate with others and learn like I did in the first version
- Improve system design by learning from mistakes and oversights in v1
- Go... so far it's been a great language to learn!

---

Obviously this and many things will change. In it's current state it's just me trying to get the ground work done to then build on top of as I pick the old project apart. I am always open to suggestions and collaboration as you should be able to tell from the first project!

Can't wait to have something to launch ðŸ˜ƒ
